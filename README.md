# Chatbot Flutter Application With Dialogflow

Chatbot is an virtual bot that can reply to user question on which it has to be trained and complied in such a way that it works and answers the user question easily !!

For that we need to have an Algorithm but at this stage, We dont need any one of these we can esily have the DIALOGFLOW so as to train the bot and the algo works from thier side itself !!

We just need to integrate the dilaoflow to our application so that we can have the conversation in the mobile app !!
